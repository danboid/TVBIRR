# TVBIRR

TV Box Internet Radio Recorder is an ansible playbook to configure a X96 Max+ (or similar, if you adjust the playbook) TV box to act as an internet radio streaming and recording device that you can operate entirely with the infrared remote included with the TV box. TVBIRR uses JACK for audio playback and records the stream using jack_capture. You can see when jack_capture is recording the currently played station because CARD is displayed on the TV box LED display.
